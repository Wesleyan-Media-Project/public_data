## Introduction
This repo contains links to data made publically available by the Wesleyan Media Project. <br>
Currently, this consists of a file which contains aggregate weekly spending compiled from the Facebook Aggregate Report from the period 1/26/2020 to 11/7/2020 for all page name and disclaimer combinations that were identified by the Wesleyan Media Project as being associated with a page ID that was caught through keyword searches of the API for all federal candidate names during the general election period 9/1/2020 through Election Day. <br>
However, in terms of files, this repo contains just this README, and it should therefore not be downloaded into a folder as many of the other repos are. <br>
To access the data that is linked to in this repo, click on the link in the setup section. 
<br>
For data from prior to 2020, as well as data that can't be made publicly available (such as data provided to us by Kantar Media/CMAG), see: https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/dataaccess/
